# STM157_OpenSourceHouseControlWithDoorBell
## For the project:
### This project is setted up for the purpose of showing my coding capbility.
### All codes does not related to any company's business.

## For the Design:
### When you get home, opening the door with your fingerprint, then seeing the message on the control center screen: Dear, You have a parcel in the parcel locker.
### You look at the screen. It's showing the remainder of water supply, power supply, gas supply, and the house temperature. The control center is suggesting you open the air condition.
### You click the screen, showing who visited your room and who operated your control center when you're outside in fast speed.
### Then you closed the supervisor by AI face recoganition, enjoying your watching tv.
### ...

## For the realization:
### It needs a solution with parcel locker system of community. Need a standard api of it.
### It need connect with electric door locker. A standred api of it.
### The user interface, the main system, this project is, I'm realizing it.

## Coding Starndards
1. use basic data types: int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, int64_t, uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t, float, double, void
2. b*****: int8_t, byte
3. w*****: int16_t, word
4. dw*****: int32_t, double words
5. qw*****: int64_t, quad words
6. ub*****: uint8_t, unsigned byte
7. uw*****: uint16_t, usigned word
8. udw*****: uint32_t, usigned double words
9. uqw*****: uint64_t, usigned quad words
10. pb*****: int8_t*, pointer byte
11. pw*****: int16_t*, pointer word
12. pdw*****: int32_t*, pointer double words
13. pqw*****: int64_t*, pointer quad words
14. pub*****: uint8_t*, pointer usigned byte
15. puw*****: uint16_t*, pointer usigned word
16. pudw*****: uint32_t*, pointer usigned double words
17. puqw*****: uint64_t*, pointer usigned quad words
18. pv******: void*, pointer void
